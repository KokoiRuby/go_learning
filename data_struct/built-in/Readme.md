Go's standard library provides several built-in data structures that are readily available for use in various applications.

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections of elements of the same type. The size of an array is part of its type.
- **Slices**: Dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. They are more commonly used than arrays.
- **Maps**: Collection of key-value pairs, providing average O(1) time complexity for lookups, inserts, and deletes.
- **Strings**: Immutable sequences of bytes, often used to store text. They have a rich set of methods for manipulation.
- **Channels**: Typed conduits through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, `<-`. They are used for communication between goroutines.
- **container/[list](https://pkg.go.dev/container/list)**: Provides a doubly linked list.
- **container/[heap](https://pkg.go.dev/container/heap@go1.22.5)**: Provides heap operations for implementing priority queues.
- **container/[ring](https://pkg.go.dev/container/ring@go1.22.5)**: Provides circular list (ring buffer) functionality.
- **Sets**: While Go doesn't have a built-in set type, you can use maps to implement sets. [golang-set](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go?tab=readme-ov-file#sets).
- **[sync.Map](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Map)**: A map with safe concurrent access.
- **[math/bits](math/bits)**: Provides bit manipulation functions, although not a full bit set data structure.
